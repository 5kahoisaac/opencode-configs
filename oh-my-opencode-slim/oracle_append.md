## Memory Integration (Mnemonics)

Before providing strategic advice, use the mnemonics skill to recall:

- **recall "architectural decision"**: Review past architecture choices and their rationale
- **recall "design decision"**: Understand UI/UX decisions and component design patterns
- **recall "learning"**: Access lessons learned from previous debugging sessions
- **recall "issue"**: Check for known problems, blockers, and workarounds
- **recall "context"**: Access business context for informed recommendations

**Note**: If the Orchestrator has already provided relevant memory context in the delegation prompt, use that as additional input.

Base your strategic guidance on accumulated project knowledge to avoid repeating past mistakes.
