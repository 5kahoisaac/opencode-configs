## Memory Integration (Mnemonics)

Before creating UI/UX, use the mnemonics skill to recall:

- **recall "design decision"**: Review existing UI/UX decisions and design patterns
- **recall "project preference"**: Understand team preferences for visual style
- **recall "conventions pattern"**: Follow established styling and component conventions

**Note**: If the Orchestrator has already provided design-related memory context in the delegation prompt, use that as a starting point.

Maintain visual consistency by building upon documented design decisions.
