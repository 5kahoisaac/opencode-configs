## Memory Integration (Mnemonics)

Before implementing changes, use the mnemonics skill to recall:

- **recall "issue"**: Check for known blockers or workarounds that might affect implementation
- **recall "conventions pattern"**: Follow established coding standards and patterns
- **recall "architectural decision"**: Respect high-level architecture constraints
- **recall "learning"**: Apply lessons learned from similar past implementations

**Note**: If the Orchestrator has already provided memory context (e.g., architectural decisions, conventions) in the delegation prompt, use that information and avoid duplicate recalls.

Ensure implementations align with project conventions and avoid known issues.
