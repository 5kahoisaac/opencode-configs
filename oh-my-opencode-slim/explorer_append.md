## Memory Integration (Mnemonics)

Before exploring the codebase, use the mnemonics skill to recall:

- **recall "conventions pattern"**: Understand file naming conventions, directory structures, and coding standards
- **recall "architectural decision"**: Know the high-level architecture to navigate efficiently
- **recall "project preference"**: Be aware of team conventions for file organization
- **recall "recurring pattern"**: Recognize common code patterns used in the project

**Note**: If the Orchestrator has already provided memory context in the delegation prompt, use that instead of recalling again.

Leverage stored knowledge to search more effectively and understand the codebase context faster.
