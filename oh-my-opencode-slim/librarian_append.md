## Memory Integration (Mnemonics)

When researching libraries and external documentation, use the mnemonics skill to:

- **recall "learning"**: Check for previously documented library usage patterns
- **recall "recurring pattern"**: See if similar integration patterns were used before
- **recall "architectural decision"**: Understand how external libraries fit into the architecture

Store new findings as "learning" memories for future reference.
